The sorting\ndecision is based on the image data evaluation of the sen-\nsors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process\nparameters must be set depending on the properties of the\nmaterial stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the re-\nquired sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and\nre-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and\nmaterial stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an\napproach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting\nthe process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based\non Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models\nare used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for\nsystem behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This\nmethod minimizes the number of necessary experiments while\nsimultaneously considering two possible optimization targets\nbased on the requirements for both material output streams. In\naddition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting\naccuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method\nwith three example process parameters.\nIndex Terms \u2014Sensor-Based Sorting, Process Optimization,\nBayesian Optimization, Surrogate-Based Optimization, Gaussian\nProcess Regression\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nSensor-based sorting (SBS) systems are essential in various\nindustries to efficiently separate material streams into different\nfractions based on sensor data evaluation and control of\nactuators. Typical fields of application include quality control\nin manufacturing processes, agricultural and food industries,\nmineral processing, and recycling operations. Examples of\nsorting tasks are the removal of fungus-infested kernels from\nseeds, the enrichment of ores in industrial minerals or the\nsorting of plastic waste according to polymer type. Hence,\npractical and precise sorting enhances product quality and\nsignificantly contributes to resource conservation and sustain-\nability [1].\nTo achieve optimal sorting results, it is necessary to pa-\nrameterize process parameters carefully [2]. Optimizing these\nparameters presents a complex challenge due to the intri-\ncate interactions between the sensors and actuators and the\nFig. 1.

The key parameters for the\nconfiguration of the actuators for ejection must be carefully\nselected depending on the material properties, the system\ndimensions, and the desired sorting accuracy, and also adjusted\nduring sorting operation if the properties of the material stream\nchange. Manual adjustments by experts are time-consuming\nand may not effectively adapt to changes, such as variations\nin loading density or material properties, such as size, weight,\nor shape.\nThis paper introduces a methodology that employs Bayesian\noptimization (BO) using Gaussian process regression (GPR)\nmodels as surrogate models to optimize and recurrently ad-\njust the process parameters of SBS systems. An overview\nof the approach is provided in Figure 1. By capturing the\ncomplex interactions between the process parameters and\nsorting results, this approach allows for efficient exploration\nof the parameter space and improves sorting performance,\neven under uncertainties and variable conditions. This methodarXiv:2507.22766v1  [cs.LG]  30 Jul 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\naccounts for the inherent noise in the observed data, such as\nmeasurement variances due to material throughput fluctuations\nand non-deterministic ejection behaviors caused by object\nvariations and system jitter. Our approach makes it possible to\nconsider the requirements for both material fractions resulting\nfrom the sorting process during optimization, monitor them\ncontinuously, and adjust them in-line if necessary.\nA. Related Work\nOptimization problems for adapting process parameters in\nengineering often have a high dimensionality and a nonlin-\near, non-convex behavior and are, therefore, quite complex.\nSurrogate-based optimization (SBO) is a method for reducing\nnumerical effort during parameter optimization [3]. Surrogates\nare approximations of the behavior of complex systems and\nare employed to reduce computation time and resources. In ex-\nisting work, BO is often used with a Gaussian process (GP) as\na surrogate model. BO is a strategy for the global optimization\nof an unknown objective function, which is expensive to eval-\nuate [4], [5]. GPR is used to model the process and offers the\npossibility of providing uncertainty in predicting the process\nparameter values. Practical applications for process parameter\noptimization that use BO include the search for parameters\nin the synthesis of polymer fibers [6], parameter optimization\nof powder film drying processes [7], and optimization of a\ngrinding machine process, considering quality, cost, and safety\nconstraints [8]. Further work in the field of process parameter\noptimization uses neural networks as surrogate models [9].\nFurthermore, research is being conducted on process parameter\noptimization employing reinforcement learning [10]. These\nmethods have particular strengths in the modeling of highly\ncomplex processes in variable situations.\nSeveral studies have investigated the effects of different\nprocess parameters on the sorting process. In several cases,\nsimulation models have been used for this purpose. For exam-\nple, in [11], a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine\nthe resulting sorting quality for different mass flows. The\nresults suggest that sorting quality decreases exponentially as\nmass flow increases. However, the authors did not consider\nthe varying mass flows over time. In [12], a multitude of\npotentially varying process parameters, such as mass flow and\nparticle velocity, were considered to determine the optimal\noperation points of a sorting system. The authors employed\na coupled discrete element method and computational fluid\ndynamics to numerically simulate the sorting process. The\nsame type of simulation was used in [13]. Here, the authors\nmodeled a sorting system with recirculation and introduced\na closed-loop controller to improve the sorting quality. This\nwork was further extended in [14], where the authors proposed\na stochastic model of the sorting system in combination with\na stochastic nonlinear model predictive controller for closed-\nloop control of the sorting system.II. S ENSOR -BASED SORTING SYSTEMS\nA. Functional Principle\nSBS systems offer solutions for physically separating a\nmaterial stream into predefined classes. In many cases, the\naim is to remove inferior parts from a material stream,\nresulting in a binary sorting task. The task can therefore be\nunderstood as an accept-or-reject decision. Material is fed\nonto a transportation mechanism, for instance, a conveyor belt\nor chute, and observed by one or multiple sensors during\ntransportation at the so-called inspection line. While the choice\nof sensors depends on the sorting task at hand, i.e., which\nmaterial properties are to be made \u201cvisible\u201d, line-scanning,\nimaging sensors are commonly used. The captured image data\nare processed to localize and classify individual objects. The\nclassification results serve as the basis for the sorting decisions.\nTypically, a bounding box represents the size and position\nof each object. Fast-switching pneumatic valves are generally\nused to separate individual objects from the material stream.\nThe valves are arranged in a row orthogonal to the main\ntransport direction, e.g., the running direction of the conveyor\nbelt. Individual nozzles can be activated to eject individual\nobjects.\nAssuming a constant speed for the bulk material during\ntransport on the conveyor belt, a fixed delay time between\nsensor detection and ejection can be set. Both the number of\nactivated nozzles and the duration of activation are adjustable\nand depend on the size of the detected objects.\nThe sorting quality achieved depends primarily on the\nclassification accuracy of the bulk material objects and correct\nphysical ejection. Depending on the material and structure,\nvarious process parameters can influence and optimize the\ntiming and accuracy of the separation.\nB. Process Parameters in Sensor-Based Sorting Systems\nAn SBS system consists of many process parameters that\ninfluence the sorting process and, therefore, have a significant\nimpact on the quality of the sorting result, both in terms of the\nreject and the accept fraction [2]. The process parameters are\nconfigured primarily during the system commissioning. Ad-\njustments are made if it is observed during the operation that\nthe setting no longer delivers the expected results. Changes\nin sorting behavior can be caused by changes in the input\nmaterial flow, such as alterations in the loading density, or\nvarying material properties, such as size, weight, or shape.\nThe results of the sensor data evaluation are the identifica-\ntion and localization of the individual bulk material objects\nin the form of a class label and bounding box, defined as\n(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), where xminandxmaxrepresent the\nhorizontal limits of the object on the conveyor belt, and ymin\nandymaxrepresent the vertical limits of the object as detected\nby the imaging sensor (example in [15]).\nOur investigations focus on three relevant process parame-\nters that significantly influence sorting behavior and presum-\nably have the most substantial impact. All parameters are\nrelated to the interaction between the analyzed imaging sensor\n\n--- Page 3 ---\ndata and actuators used to eject defined material classes or\nobjects using a pneumatic nozzle array:\n\u2022Reaction Lines ( TR): The delay time TRbetween the\nfirst appearance of an object under the inspection line of a\nline-scanning imaging sensor and the extraction actuator.\nThe delay when opening or activating the compressed\nair nozzle, represented by \u2206Tnozzle , and the general jitter\n\u2206Tjittershould not be neglected when setting the param-\neters. The effective reaction time can be expressed as\nTeffective =TR+ \u2206Tnozzle+ \u2206Tjitter.\n\u2022Extended Time ( TE): The parameter TEdenotes the\nenlargement of the bounding box of a detected object\nalong the time axis, perpendicular to the inspection\nline. The result is an extension of the nozzle activation\nduring ejection. This influence can be described as the\ntemporal extension \u2206TEapplied to the initial bounding\nbox time dimension, Sbox. Thus, the extended time is\nTextended =Tbox+ \u2206TE.\n\u2022Extended Space ( SE): The parameter SEindicates the\nenlargement of the bounding box of a detected object\nvertically to the conveyor belt movement. This results in\na broadened ejection window, potentially activating more\ncompressed air nozzles during the ejection. The spatial\nextension \u2206SEis applied to the initial bounding box\nspatial dimension Sbox, leading to Sextended =Sbox+\u2206SE.\nThus, the mathematically redefined bounding box considering\nTEandSEextensions can be expressed as\n\u0012\nxmin\u2212\u2206SE\n2, ymin\u2212\u2206TE\n2, x max+\u2206SE\n2, ymax+\u2206TE\n2\u0013\n.\nThe line-scan camera delivers image lines in a fixed cycle.\nThis line clock serves as the time coordinate in the proposed\nsystem. Hence, the units for TRandTEare given in lines\n(LTR/E), which can be converted to time with the recording\nfrequency, using TR=LTr\nfandTE=LTe\nf. The accuracy of\nthe parameter SEusually is limited to the length of one pixel.\nWhen manually adjusting the three parameters, a compro-\nmise must be made between the desired sorting objectives. If\nthe goal is to eject and accurately target as many reject objects\nas possible, high values for the parameters TEand especially\nSEare suitable; however, with high material occupancy, more\nacceptable parts are also ejected. Therefore, the objectives of\nthe two resulting reject andaccept material streams must be\ndefined based on the economic requirements and demands of\nsubsequent processing operations.\nC. Sorting Accuracy Determination\nTo optimize the process parameters, a feedback loop in-\nvolving the current sorting results and the desired sorting\naccuracies is required. We assume an SBS system is integrated\ninto a processing chain with subsequent systems and processes\n(see Figure 1). By leveraging the sensor data from this setup,\nwe can determine the sorting quality effectively.\nTwo imaging sensors are utilized: one observes the dis-\ncharged material stream (accepted objects), and the other\nmonitors the unaffected material stream (rejected objects).These sensors detect bulk material objects after sorting, so\nthe sorting quality can be evaluated using a confusion matrix.\nThe process is as follows:\n1) Using imaging sensors to monitor the two resulting\nmaterial streams after sorting.\n2) Analyzing the image data and counting objects based\non their classes to determine their distribution in each\nstream.\n3) Compiling the results into a confusion matrix with four\ncategories:\n\u2022True Positives (TP): Number of objects that belong\nto the accept class and were correctly sorted into\nthe accept stream.\n\u2022False Negatives (FN): Number of objects that be-\nlong to the reject class but were incorrectly sorted\ninto the accept stream.\n\u2022True Negatives (TN): Number of objects that belong\nto the reject class and were correctly sorted into the\nreject stream.\n\u2022False Positives (FP): Number of objects that belong\nto the reject class but were incorrectly sorted into\nthe accept stream.\nThe resulting confusion matrix is expressed as:\nPredicted Accept Predicted Reject\nActual Accept TP FN\nActual Reject FP TN\nThe total number of objects Ntotalis calculated as the sum\nof all detected objects. The accuracy of the sorting process is\nthen determined according to\nAccuracy =TP+TN\nNtotal. (1)\nThis metric provides a quantitative assessment of the sort-\ning system\u2019s performance, enabling targeted adjustments to\nimprove overall accuracy. To evaluate the accept and reject\nstreams separately, the normalized TP and TN values can be\nused, which are calculated by dividing the number of objects\nclassified by the sensors into the accept or reject classes:\nTPn=TP\nTP+FN, TN n=TN\nTN+FP. (2)\nAssuming constant sorting rates and processing rates, as\nwell as the independence of the objects\u2019 processing, a correla-\ntion between variance and duration of an observation interval\nor a measurement can be determined. Since we count the\nnumber of objects over a specific period, the number of TP\nand TN follows a binomial distribution. The total number of\nobserved objects nwas proportional to the data collection time\nt(assuming a constant processing rate r). It turns out that\nthe variance of the TP and TN measurements are inversely\nproportional to the data acquisition time tas given by\nVar(\u02c6p)\u221d1\nt. (3)\nThe longer the data collection time, the greater the number\nof observed objects n, and the smaller the variance of the\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nestimated TP rate. Therefore, a longer data collection time\nleads to more reliable and stable TP rate measurement. This\nis crucial for evaluating the sorting system\u2019s performance\nbecause a lower variance allows for better differentiation\nbetween random fluctuations and actual system changes.\nIn both the actual data evaluation of the imaging sensors for\nthe actual sorting process and the downstream data evaluation\nto determine the sorting quality, it is assumed that there is\nno sensory false identification of the objects. While this is\nobviously unrealistic and not the case, we argue that depending\non the material flow, false classification rates are very low in\nrelation to the material or object throughput, and their influ-\nence on the calculated sorting quality is, therefore, negligible.\nThe variance of the accuracy due to misclassifications can\nbe approximated by\nVar(Accuracy ) =p(1\u2212p)\nNtotal, (4)\nwhere pis the true classification accuracy rate.\nIn cases with very few misclassifications and a large Ntotal,\nthe variance becomes negligible, indicating minimal impact\non the measured sorting accuracy. Therefore, with many ob-\nservations and few errors, sorting accuracy remains a reliable\nmetric for system performance evaluation.\nD. Data Acquisition\nAn in-house lab-scale sorting system with results and\nphysical properties that can be directly scaled up to larger\nsystems was utilized in our study. Bricks and sand-lime bricks\nwere selected as exemplary bulk material streams. Because\nof the different color characteristics (red and white), the\nmisclassifications in the image data evaluation can be assumed\nto be close to zero. The two material streams, i.e., accepted\nand rejected, were also recorded after sorting using the same\ncamera model and evaluation algorithm to describe the sorting\naccuracy using the confusion matrix described above. The\nobservation period for parameter configuration was divided\ninto several parts to monitor the variance of the results over\ntime.\nThe following values were determined for the three system\nparameters and collected over a longer period:\n\u2022TR={12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21}\n\u2022ET={0,2,4,6,8}\n\u2022SE={0,2,4,6,8}\nThe data units are camera lines or pixels; however, for read-\nability, they are neglected in the remainder. The total set of\nparameter combinations is the Cartesian Product of these sets,\nTR\u00d7ET\u00d7SE, resulting in 250 possible combinations and\nsorting experiments.\nThe measurement data were collected for approximately 3\nto 5 minutes for each parameter configuration. The number\nof objects was determined every 10 seconds. For this time\nspan a confusion matrix was created, and the derived metrics\nwere calculated. This setting is a compromise depending on\nthe set material throughput, the reduction of the measurement\nnoise according to (3), and the competing reduction of the\n/uni00000014/uni00000015 /uni00000014/uni00000016 /uni00000014/uni00000017 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000014/uni0000001a /uni00000014/uni0000001b /uni00000014/uni0000001c /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000014\n/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni0000004f/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001b/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000051/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000050/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni0000004c/uni0000005d/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000037/uni00000033\n/uni00000014/uni00000015 /uni00000014/uni00000016 /uni00000014/uni00000017 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000014/uni0000001a /uni00000014/uni0000001b /uni00000014/uni0000001c /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000014\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\nFig. 2.

The final sorting performance is\ndetermined by averaging over the entire measurement interval.\nThe noise in the measured values can be estimated using\nshorter statistical intervals.\nE. First Examination of the Data\nFigure 2 shows the normalized TP and TN metrics as a\nfunction of the reaction lines parameter (other parameter val-\nues were constantly set to zero) of the acquired data as a box\nplot. The variance of the normalized TP measurements was\nsignificantly lower because of the higher number of objects\nin the accepted material flow, which led to more accurate\nmeasurements. The reject material flow is significantly lower,\nso the physical ejection errors have a greater direct influence\non the metric.\nWhen looking at the reaction lines parameter in isolation,\nit can be seen that the normalized TP value resembles a\nquadratic function with a clear maximum. The timing for the\nbest ejection point is good only at one point; if ejected too\nearly or too late, no object can be hit efficiently. However,\nthe relationship with the other two parameters is less easy to\nexplain and visualize. For this reason, a GPR model is used,\nwhich can better recognize the relationships.\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\nA. Problem Definition\nThe optimization of the process parameters of SBS systems\ndiffers from other problems in process parameter optimization.\nOne challenge is the noise observed in the experiment, i.e., the\nsorting accuracy measured in the subsequent processes. The\ncalculated accuracy metrics were subject to substantial varia-\ntions, mainly depending on the material throughput within the\nmeasurement interval and class distribution. At the same time,\nthe ejection behavior is not deterministic due to individual\nobject sizes, shapes, flight behavior, jitter in the control of\nthe compressed air nozzles, and many other factors. After a\nsorting experiment with defined process parameters, the result\nis subject to uncertainties, different from other studies and\nprocess parameter optimization examples.\nAnother special feature in the context of SBS systems is that\nthe two output streams, accepted and rejected, can be subject to\ndifferent requirements. For example, the accept stream should\nbe as pure as possible and free from foreign objects, whereas\nthe composition of the reject stream is irrelevant. However,\nother requirements are possible, depending on the individual\nsorting requirements. Therefore, optimization must make it\npossible to weigh the requirements for the output streams\nindividually.\nB. Bayesian Optimization using a Gaussian Process as Sur-\nrogate Model\nBO is a powerful strategy for the global optimization of\nblack-box functions, which are expensive to evaluate and\nlack analytical expressions. It is beneficial in scenarios where\nfunction evaluations are costly, such as hyperparameter tuning\nin machine learning models, engineering design optimization,\nand experimental sciences [16].\nAt the core of the BO, there are two primary components:\na surrogate probabilistic model and an acquisition function.\nThe surrogate model, often a GP, approximates an unknown\nobjective function based on prior observations. The acquisition\nfunction leverages the predictive distribution of the surrogate\nmodel to determine the next point to be evaluated by balancing\nexploration and exploitation.\nA GP is a distribution over functions, such that any finite\nset of function values f(x1), f(x2), ...f(xN)have a joint\nGaussian distribution. It is fully specified by its mean function\nm(x)and covariance function k(x,x\u2032)according to\nf(x)\u223c GP (m(x), k(x,x\u2032)). (5)\nThe covariance function also called the kernel , defines the rela-\ntionship between function values at different points according\nto\nCov[f(x), f(x\u2032)] =k(x,x\u2032) (6)\n=E[(f(x)\u2212m(x))(f(x\u2032)\u2212m(x\u2032))]. (7)\nTypically, the mean function is assumed to be zero: m(x) =\nE[f(x)] = 0 . Uncertainty regarding the mean function can be\nconsidered by adding an extra term to the kernel [17].Given a set of observations D={(xi, yi)}n\ni=1, where\nyi=f(xi) +\u03f5and\u03f5\u223c N (0, \u03c32\nn)represents noise, the\nGPR model can be updated to provide predictions at new\npoints with associated uncertainties [18]. When a GP is applied\nto regression problems with observed data, this approach is\nreferred to as GPR.\nThe expected improvement (EI) is a common acquisition\nfunction that balances the potential improvement over the\ncurrent best observation, as given by\n\u03b1EI(x) =(fbest\u2212\u00b5(x))\u00b7\n\u03a6\u0012fbest\u2212\u00b5(x)\n\u03c3(x)\u0013\n+\u03c3(x)\u03d5\u0012fbest\u2212\u00b5(x)\n\u03c3(x)\u0013\n, (8)\nwhere \u00b5(x)and\u03c3(x)are the predictive mean and standard\ndeviation at x,fbestis the best-observed value, and \u03a6(\u00b7)and\n\u03d5(\u00b7)are the cumulative and probability density functions of\nthe standard normal distribution, respectively.\nC. Strategy for Optimizing Process Parameter in Sensor-\nBased Sorting Systems Using Parallel Bayesian Optimization\nand a Combined Expected Improvement\nIn the following section, the optimization process for the\nprocess parameters of an SBS system is introduced, in which\ndifferent requirements can be placed on the two output material\nstreams. An efficient strategy for simultaneously optimizing\nthe two requirements, which may work against each other, is\nto calculate two separate GPR models for each output: the\naccept and reject streams.\nThe requirements for the accept and reject material streams\nare combined by calculating the introduced combined EI, in\nwhich the objectives for the accuracy of both material streams\nare weighted. Therefore, the EI must first be determined for\neach separate GPR model:\ncombined EI =waccept\u00b7EIaccept+wreject\u00b7EIreject (9)\nwith weights waccept+wreject= 1.

Sequence of the Bayesian optimization (BO) approach of the process\nparameters of a sensor-based sorting system using two separate Gaussian\nprocess regression (GPR) models for the accepted and rejected material\nstreams and a combined expected improvement (EI).\nIV. A PPLICATION OF THE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY TO\nTHE PROCESS PARAMETERS OF A SENSOR -BASED\nSORTING SYSTEM\nThe optimization process was evaluated using the presented\ndataset and sorting scenario. After a defined set of initial exper-\niments, two GPR models were calculated using the obtained\nnormalized TP and TN metrics, as well as the estimation of\nthe measurements\u2019 variance. The combined EI was calculated\nusing the separate EI of the two models, which were scaled\nwith a weight of 0.5for this test. Subsequently, using the\nnewly derived parameter configuration, a new experiment can\nbe conducted in the form of a time-limited sorting process. The\ndatabase containing the sorting results was then expanded.\nUncertainty is considered in the kernel in the form of the\nvariance of the individual measurement intervals during the\nsorting process to calculate the GPR models. The influence\non the kernel must be weighted due to dependencies onTABLE I\nRESULTING NEXT PROCESS PARAMETER SET XFOR EACH OPTIMIZATION\nSTEP AFTER MAXIMIZING THE COMBINED EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT (EI)\nUSING ALL COMBINATIONS OF THE STARTING PARAMETER SET\n[TR, ET, SE]start = [{12,18,21},{0,8},{0,8}].\nStep arg max Xcombined EI (X)\nNumber Reaction Lines Extended Time Extended Space\n1 15.67 7.51 2.29\n2 14.57 0.82 6.04\n3 14.76 1.80 6.20\nthe duration of the acquisition intervals and the material\nthroughput rate. Using the example of the single isolated\nparameter reaction lines ( TR), the variance of the normalized\nTP metric and the effects on the GPR are plotted in Figure 4\nfor different scalings using the weight \u03bband a small subset of\nexperiments. If the weighting in the kernel is too high ( \u03bb\u22651),\nthe result is generalized with high uncertainties overall. Values\nfar less than one ( 0\u2264\u03bb\u226a1) or even zero enable a better-\nfitting model despite the relatively shorter acquisition interval\nof the sorting result. However, overfitting is highly likely to\noccur. Therefore, the variance estimation for the GP model\ncalculations was weighted with \u03bb= 0.1, offering the best\ngeneralization.\nThe boundaries of the search space can be freely determined\nwhen calculating the EI value for both models. It is recom-\nmended and generally necessary to include prior knowledge of\nwhich parameter intervals are reasonable. For the evaluation,\nthe search space was constrained to the difference between the\nlimit values of the initial start parameter set plus minus one.\nThe initial number of experiments was set to 12, comprising\na combination of three reaction lines parameters and two\nextended space and time parameters:\n[TR, ET, SE]start= [{12,18,21},{0,8},{0,8}].\nThe number of parameters determines the duration of the ini-\ntial experiments. Therefore, they should be as few as possible\nand cover the parameter space as well as possible. Expert\nknowledge can be used in the selection process to reduce the\nnumber of options and minimize the exploration space. Table I\nlists the proposed parameters after calculating the combined EI\nafter the initial sorting experiments using [TR, ET, SE]startand\neach subsequent experiment. The settings in the sorting system\nsoftware only allow integer values. Therefore, parameter val-\nues must be rounded to existing adjustable values if necessary.\nAfter three steps, the optimization converges, yielding the final\nparameter set. It can be seen that the reaction lines parameter\nconverges purposefully, whereas the relationships between the\nextended time and extended space parameters appear more\nchallenging.\nUsing all measured values from the dataset, a GPR model\nwas calculated to derive the optimum parameter configura-\ntion and thus to assess the result of the recursive optimiza-\ntion. The optimal result calculated from the maximum value\nof the calculated regression model is [TR, ET, SE]best =\n[15.27,1.29,6.30]. The optimum configuration of the reaction\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n/uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000013\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000056/uni00000046/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000037/uni00000033\n/uni0000000b/uni00000014/uni0000000c\n/uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000048\n/uni0000000b/uni00000015/uni0000000c\n/uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000048\n/uni0000000b/uni00000016/uni0000000c\n/uni00000033/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni0000004c/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051\n/uni0000001c/uni00000018/uni00000008/uni00000003/uni00000026/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000049/uni0000004c/uni00000047/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002c/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000059/uni00000044/uni0000004f\n/uni00000037/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000003/uni00000027/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000044\n/uni00000036/uni00000057/uni00000044/uni00000051/uni00000047/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000047/uni00000048/uni00000059/uni0000004c/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051Fig. 4. Results of the Gaussian process regression (GPR) models for predicting the normalized and scaled TP value based on the reaction lines parameter\nfor different weightings of the variance in the calculation of the GPR models.

The most robust value\nis the time point of the object center point of the compressed\nair nozzle (neglected by the jitter of the nozzle activation).\nThe extended time was short, and the objects were similar in\nshape and approximately complex. Due to possible transverse\nmovements between the sensor line and nozzle array, it is\nrecommended to select a larger extended space to reliably hit\nand eject objects.\nThe evolution of one of the GPR models, namely the model\nof the normalized TP value, is shown in Figure 5. For the first\nGPR model, which was calculated using the values from the\ninitial sorting experiments, two of the three process parameters\nwere plotted against the mean of the predicted TP values. The\nsecond diagram illustrates the GPR model derived using the\ncomplete dataset encompassing all measurements. Although\nthe GPR model is initially imprecise and appears to have\nseveral local maxima and minima, the ideal model, which was\niteratively adjusted at each optimization step, is smoother.\nFor further investigation, the optimization strategy was\napplied once more with the same starting set of process\nparameters, but with different prioritization of the SBS pro-\ncess\u2019s output stream properties. This behavior was achieved by\nselecting distinct weight values when calculating the combined\nEI. The results are presented in Table II. A higher weighting of\nthe accepted material stream property, that is, a higher required\npurity, leads to higher values of the extended space parameter.\nTherefore, objects are ejected more generously, with the risk\nof ejecting additional neighboring, actually accepting objects.\nThe reaction lines remained relatively constant.\nThe process parameters of an SBS system were successfully\noptimized based on a starting set of parameters and experi-\nments using the selected sorting problem as an example. In\naddition, the results of the different prioritization of the ac-\ncepted or rejected streams are shown. The resulting parameter\nvalues are reasonable, considering the optimization goal.\nV.

In addition, a method is presented in which the\nrequirements can be placed on the purity of the resulting\nmaterial streams after sorting. Three exemplary process pa-\nrameters were successfully optimized using an example sorting\nscenario, and the method\u2019s advantages were demonstrated and\ndiscussed. Starting with a minimum initial parameter set and\nsorting experiments, an optimum parameter configuration was\nfound in only a few steps.\nThe theoretical use of the optimization for an inline param-\neter adjustment based on, for example, a change in material\nflow was indicated.
